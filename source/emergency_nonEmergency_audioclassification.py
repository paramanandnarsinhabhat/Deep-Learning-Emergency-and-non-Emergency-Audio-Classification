# Understanding the Problem Statement

'''
According to the National Crime Records Bureau, nearly 24,012 people die each day due to a delay in getting medical assistance. Many accident victims wait for help at the site, and a delay costs them their lives. The reasons could range from ambulances stuck in traffic to the fire brigade not being able to reach the site on time due to traffic jams. 

The solution to the above problem is to create a system that automatically detects the emergency vehicle prior to reaching the traffic signals and change the traffic signals accordingly.
